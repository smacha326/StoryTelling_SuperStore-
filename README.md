# StoryTelling_SuperStore-
This was a Storytelling project that I created using simulated data during my time as a BIA trainee with TripleTen
##  Part 1: Finding the Root Causes of Returns

First, I joined the Returns table with the Orders table so I could compare which products were returned and which werenâ€™t.

### What I did:
- Created a field where:
  - `Yes = 1` (returned)
  - `null = 0` (not returned)
- Used this to calculate **return rates** and **total returns**

### Charts I created:
1. **Scatterplot** â€“ Compared total sales vs. total returns by product subcategory  
   â†’ Do higher sales always mean more returns?

2. **Bar chart** â€“ Return rate by product category  
   â†’ Which product types are returned the most?

3. **Customer chart** â€“ Return rate by customer (filtered to only customers with 2+ orders)  
   â†’ Whoâ€™s returning the most?

4. **Map** â€“ Return rate by state  
   â†’ Are some areas returning more than others?

5. **Line chart** â€“ Return rate by month  
   â†’ Is there a seasonal trend?

6. **Composite visuals** â€“ Mixes of geography + category, and time + subcategory  
   â†’ To see patterns across more than one factor

## ðŸ“Š Part 2: Building the Dashboard

To pull everything together, I made a dashboard in Tableau to explore return behavior.

### Steps I followed:
- Sketched out 3 layout ideas on paper
- Chose one and created a template in Tableau using containers
- Added my charts and visuals into the dashboard
- Added filters, titles, and tooltips to make it easy to use

The goal was to make it clear and helpful for someone who wants to figure out **why returns are happening and what to do about them**.

##  Part 3: Telling the Story

I turned my analysis into a Tableau Story â€” kind of like a slideshow â€” to explain what I found.

### Whatâ€™s included:
- Summary of the return problem
- Why I used return rate (vs. total returns or cost)
- Main causes of returns I discovered
- Breakdown of what each chart shows and how to use it
- Steps the store can take (like investigating top returners or problem products)
- A conclusion with next steps â€” like using the dashboard going forward
